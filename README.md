### 🔹 **Web Development Projects:**
- 🗄️ **Android Database Management App**: Developed an **Android application** with an **SQLite** database and an intuitive user interface for managing stored data. Implemented CRUD operations for all tables and enforced role-based access control, where clients can view, add, and modify data, while administrators have full control, including deletion. User authentication is secured with hashed passwords for enhanced security.

### 🔹 **Embedded Projects:**
- 🖥️  **Game of Life on Microcontroller**: Implemented **Conway’s Game of Life** on an LED matrix display, powered by an **ATmega164A microcontroller**. Utilized a **MAX7219 driver** to control a 4-matrix LED display, simulating the evolution of cellular automata based on predefined survival, birth, and death rules. The system runs autonomously, displaying stable structures and moving patterns in real time.
